    <h1> Reina's Mochi Icecream Recipe </h1>
    <p>For the Filling: 1 pint (approx. 2 cups) strawberry ice cream.<br>
For the Mochi Dough<br>
1 cup sweet glutinous rice flour (e.g., Mochiko brand).<br>
¼ cup granulated sugar.<br>
¾ to 1 cup liquid (either water, milk, or a mix of both).<br>
Optional: 1–2 drops pink food coloring or 1 tbsp strawberry puree for flavor/color.<br>
        INSTRUCTIONS<br>
For Dusting: ½ cup cornstarch or potato starch (to prevent sticking).  <br>
        Prepare the ice cream: Scoop the strawberry ice cream into small balls and freeze them solid on a parchment-lined tray.<br>
Mix the dough: In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the glutinous rice flour, sugar, and liquid (water/milk) until smooth. Add food coloring or puree if using.<br>
Cook the dough: Cover the bowl and microwave on high for about 2-3 minutes, stirring halfway through, until the dough is translucent and cooked.<br>
Assemble: Dust a surface with cornstarch or potato starch. Roll out the warm mochi dough, cut into circles, place a frozen ice cream ball in the center, and seal the edges.<br>
Freeze: Freeze the completed mochi for at least 30 minutes before serving.<br>
